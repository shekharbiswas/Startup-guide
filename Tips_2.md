# Team & Execution

- I wanna do a startup. you wanna do the startup? lets do together --- **Worst way** to choose partners.
- Better to have no co-founder than a bad one. **Go Solo.** ( song : ekla cholo re - tagore )
- technical, calm , tough etc. may be good.
- hiring as less as possible, initially.
